# Deep Learning-Assisted Text Generation for Identifying Novel Anti-RNA Virus Drugs Targeting m6A Modification

## 🔬 Project Overview

This repository provides the implementation of a deep learning-driven framework designed to accelerate the discovery of novel antiviral drugs targeting N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in RNA viruses. The project combines transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) with reinforcement learning to efficiently generate and optimize molecular structures for antiviral drug discovery.

## 📖 Background

RNA viruses pose significant global health challenges, and targeting m6A RNA modifications offers a novel therapeutic approach. Traditional drug development methods, like high-throughput screening and molecular docking, are expensive, time-consuming, and limited in effectiveness. 

This project addresses these limitations by leveraging deep learning-assisted text generation to efficiently explore and generate promising antiviral compounds.
